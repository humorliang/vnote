## linux 环境搭建go 

**环境安装**
```
# Remove old golang, for me it is: rm -rf /usr/local/go 
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.14.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.14.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# Add these lines to your $HOME/.bashrc
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin/:/go/bin
export GOPATH=/go
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go

source $HOME/.bashrc
```

```sh
# 0. download go pkg
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.16.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz

# 1. Remove any previous Go installation by deleting the /usr/local/go folder (if it exists),
#  then extract the archive you just downloaded into /usr/local, creating a fresh Go tree in /usr/local/go:
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.16.10.linux-amd64.tar.gz
# (You may need to run the command as root or through sudo).

# Do not untar the archive into an existing /usr/local/go tree. This is known to produce broken Go installations.

# Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.
# You can do this by adding the following line to your $HOME/.profile or /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation):

export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
# Note: Changes made to a profile file may not apply until the next time you log into your computer. 
# To apply the changes immediately, just run the shell commands directly or execute them from the profile using a command such as 
source $HOME/.profile.

# Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:
go version

# Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.
```
**设置go proxy**
```sh
# 配置 GOPROXY 环境变量
export GOPROXY=https://proxy.golang.com.cn,direct
# 还可以设置不走 proxy 的私有仓库或组，多个用逗号相隔（可选）
export GOPRIVATE=git.mycompany.com,github.com/my/private
```
